# <b>01.</b> Introduction

In this guide we will walk through building a modern Laravel application from scratch. Our example application will be a microblogging platform called *Chirper*.

In addition to Laravel, you will have the option of building your front-end using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) or [React](https://reactjs.org/). We will also be using [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Choose your own adventure: Vue or React

We will be providing front-end code samples for both Vue and React. Both are fantastic options for building a modern front-end application.

If you're not sure where to start, we're big fans of Vue for being beginner-friendly and extremely powerful. After you've finished the Bootcamp, you can always try it again with the other stack.

Go ahead and choose your stack:

```plain tab=Vue filename=Welcome.vue
You have selected Vue!
```

```plain tab=React filename=Welcome.jsx
You have selected React!
```

At any point you may view the code for either stack to see what life is like on the other side, just be sure not to mix the code in your project.
